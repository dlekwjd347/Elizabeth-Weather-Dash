# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Your challenge is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

Use the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve weather data for cities. The documentation includes a section called "How to start" that will provide basic setup and usage instructions. Use `localStorage` to store any persistent data.

## User Story

```
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
    form input, with userChoice for city (.form.val().trim())
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
    weather api, setItem, getItem for the city, append city to search history 
    two different elements for current and future conditions 
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
    objects and their values append to current conditions on html 
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
    UV index will have specific parameters, if/if else/else statements to color-code conditions 
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
    on future conditions element
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity
    weather api api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?q={city name}&appid={f4984700ddd88edc79d0eb1beb636dff}
    object values display on future conditions element 
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
    buttons and event listeners for each new city. city added to search history array, for loop 
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city

WHEN I open the weather dashboard
THEN I am presented with the last searched city forecast
    save all previous cities searched 
```
